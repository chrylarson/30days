Day 20

# Today’s motivation:

Balance.

At the end of my run today I took inventory of my pain points. I imagine myself to be a sphere balancing on a wire. Any pain points will cause me to topple.

While checking my balance I noticed that my right foot was feeling tension. Turns out I had been curling my toes for the past 20 days of running. That explains the blisters on that foot.

I released the tension and straightened my toes. It felt strange to let go. I immediately noticed my balance improve. After 20 days of running I’m only beginning to learn the art of running. 

Running is going to be a lifelong habit.
