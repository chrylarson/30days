Running.

For 30 days I’m going to write about running. I just completed 30 days of running at least 5km. The 30 Days of Running challenge taught me that there is so much more to learn about running. I’m going to capture my observations about running in writing. I hope that 30 Days of Writing about running will strengthen my mind and teach me to see the subtle details of running.

On first thought, running is a simple motion. Running is moving faster than walking. I just checked the Wikipedia page on running. I’m fascinated by how long the wiki article is. 30 Days ago I didn’t think there was much to running.

Running is a huge and important part of human culture. In fact, I’m beginning to think that success in running is success in everything else. Running is emotional, physical, mental and spiritual. This is especially true for longer runs. 

I’m excited to focus my writing on this one topic for 30 days.

Ready. Get set. Go.
