385 Days to become a runner.

That’s how many days between when I prioritized fitness and when I finally labeled myself a runner.

My first FitBit entry is from September 11th, 2015. I used the default goals. 10k steps was my goal. For whatever reason that silly green circle motivated me to walk 10k steps. 

I walked 10k steps for 7 months before I considered running. To meet the 10k step goal I had to go out for a walk at lunchtime. 

I work near the most beautiful stretch of the Mississippi river. Walking everyday cleared my mind and relaxed my soul. The only hurdle was getting over the fear of stepping away from my desk. When I’m 50 years old I will be thankful that I went walking instead of looking busy at my desk.

For 7 months I solidified my habit for daily activity. Only then did I consider running. First, I made fitness a priority through walking. I made walking a habit. Then, I increased my pace from walking to running.

“Walk before you run.”

I think the phrase should be “build a daily habit before committing to an audacious goal.” That’s how I see the intent of the common phrase. Walking is good, walking everyday is better. Only after a healthy physique is developed can we take on more.
