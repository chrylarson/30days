Runners are optimistic people.

Running is hard. Running hurts. Running takes time away from enjoyable activities. Still, people run.

To run is to have faith that the future will be better. Faith that the body will be stronger. Faith that the mind will be more creative. Faith that running today prepares us for the challenges of next week.

Running requires a long term outlook on life. Running improves us slowly. Each run strengthens us a little. Stacking hundreds of runs in a row and the improvements become noticeable. 

Optimism is required to get through the first month of running. Improvements are not visible the first month. It takes hundreds of runs before muscle starts to look tone and the mind responds with clearer thinking.

Before we can become runners we must train our minds to be optimistic.
